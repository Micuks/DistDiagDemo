# DBPecker: Distributed System Diagnostic Visualization Platform

## Abstract
Modern distributed systems face increasing complexity in fault diagnosis due to their scale and dynamic nature. We present DBPecker, an open-source visualization platform that enables real-time diagnosis of distributed system anomalies through multi-perspective observation and interactive root cause analysis. Our demo implements novel visualization metaphors: Root cause ranking that reveal hidden anomalies on distributed database nodes, (2) Heatmap Correlation Matrices for cross-service anomaly detection, and (3) Dynamic Trace Waterfalls that visualize request lifecycle anomalies. The system integrates with popular distributed tracing frameworks (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) and provides adaptive sampling mechanisms to handle high-volume telemetry data. Demonstration scenarios will showcase interactive diagnosis of cascading failures, resource contention patterns, and partial partition scenarios in cloud-native environments.

## Introduction

The proliferation of microservices architectures has exponentially increased the complexity of distributed system observability. While existing monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) provide adequate metric collection, they lack integrated visualization capabilities for diagnosing multi-service interaction failures. Current challenges include:

1. **Correlation Blindness**: Inability to visually correlate metrics, traces, and logs across temporal and spatial dimensions
2. **Pattern Obfuscation**: Hidden causal relationships in service call graphs during partial failure scenarios
3. **Diagnostic Latency**: Manual investigation cycles between separate monitoring and tracing tools

DBPecker addresses these challenges through three core innovations:

1. **Unified Visual Context** combining service mesh topology, request tracing, and resource metrics in a temporally synchronized display
2. **Adaptive Aggregation** techniques that preserve anomaly patterns while reducing visual clutter
3. **Interactive Hypothesis Testing** allowing operators to simulate failure propagation paths through historical data

Our implementation leverages WebGL-accelerated rendering to handle large-scale service graphs (>10k nodes) and real-time trace streaming. The demo platform includes synthetic failure injection capabilities for educational exploration of distributed system failure modes.
